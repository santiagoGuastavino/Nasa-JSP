Nasa Blogs
---

Nasa Blogs is my first approach to Java Language.  
It is also an MVC structured Java Web Servlet project.  
It was built with Eclipse (light mode) and Tomcat.  
Developed for educational purposes and for fun's sake.

I really enjoyed turning my web development knowledge into how-tos, abiding the rules of a new language.  

<!-- This project is also the first Tomcat Docker container I've deployed. Up until now, I've been using Docker containers as local instances for development purposes.  

The Docker instance was deployed using a [Northflank](https://northflank.com/)'s free tier account.  -->

The development process was possible with the help and within the framework of [Codo a Codo](https://www.buenosaires.gob.ar/educacion/codo-codo), which is a free programming academy promoted and owned by the [City of Buenos Aires](https://www.buenosaires.gob.ar/).
